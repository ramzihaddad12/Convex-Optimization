# Convex Optimization

Generating collision-free trajectories in 3D space for multiple quadcopters within seconds by minimizing the total thrust at each time step for each quadcopter using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). The goal is to transition from an initial to a final set of states, each consisting of position, velocity and acceleration. The vehicles must maintain a minimum distance between each other and satisfy other trajectory constraints.
